&gt; ShÄde シェード (Ali Diamond @endingwithali)
===========================================
Bio:
In literature and poetry, a shade is the spirit or ghost of a dead person, residing in the underworld. In definition, shade takes the form of a shelter from light, shadows that gather in the darkness, or a subtle, sneering expression of contempt or disqust for someone or something. Make no mistake, Ali earned the nickname ShÄde not out of malice - but due to her highly intellectual observations, throwing shade in such a way that's  both funny and educational. In addition, like shade, Ali is the cool-spot from the sun - a much needed darkness. As a Software Engineer she's developed and open sourced many tools, and undoubtedly will become an expert in the art of exploitation.

&gt; Arctic 北極 (Nick Sahler @tensor_bodega)
=============================================
Bio:
Arctic is the Co-Founder of Sakura Samurai. He earned his nickname due to his icy cold demeanor. Arctic is the last sole-survior of the original group in which the call sign was earned. Machine Learning Engineer by day, security researcher by night, Arctic believes that the role of hacking is to make the world a better place.

&gt; Sick.Codes 病気のコード (@sickcodes) 
=============================================
Bio:
Lover of serial numbers, the shell, and automating absolutely everything. Sick Codes was born out of a random idea to store his code on the net. He now wreaks good faith havoc on companies & codebase that like to flatter themselves. If Sick Codes is emailing your engineering team, there is something seriously ill with your code. Git master and Docker connoisseur. 2x back-to-back trending repos. No attack vector is out of the question. His hardware hacking skills are impeccable and his ability to see beyond the surface is exactly what makes him a Shogun of the highest regard.

&gt; Kirtaner キルタナー (Aubrey Cottle @Kirtaner)
=================================================
Bio:
Kirtaner has been steeped in the scene and culture since before he was in grade school. Given his own dialup modem and dedicated phone line at the age of 7, the Internet would eventually never be the same again. Kirtaner earned his nickname because he spent an awful amount of time buying garbage from 'Wirt' in Diablo I. The ultimate all-rounder and capable of absorbing new skills at an astonishing pace. The Founder of Anonymous; occasionally dabbling in the art of Ethical Research and Disclosure, but nonetheless - He is legion.
